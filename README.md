### Front End Submission

Realia allows to add properties by your users. Create the property directory by few clicks. If you want you can review newly added properties before publishing. Of course it is possible to charge users for using your website. Plugins has builtin pay per post and package system.

### Property management

Manage properties from WordPress admin. Custom version of table display is containing all important information about properties like featured image, price and assigned taxonomy terms.

### WP REST API integration

Plugin offers option to search for properties via API. Plugin adds options to filter properties by custom fields. Realia extends default API output by new fields as well. Check an API request at [wprealia.com](http://preview.wprealia.com/plugin/realia/wp-json/posts?type=property&filter-beds=3) to see how easy is to filter by custom fields. It is possible to filter by same fields as plugin uses in front end widgets. So there are available more than 20+ fields.

### Price Formatting Options

Realia supports various price formatting options. You can define the currency where you are able to set currency sign and number formatting options like number of decimal places, decimal point and thousands separator.

For properties you can set another group of price settings. You are able to write alphanumeric text instead of price amount or add your custom prefix and suffix.

Are you developer and still not satisfied with price formatting? Don't worry. Everything is located in one method so it is pretty easy to change the functionality.

### Agencies & Agents

With Realia plugin you are able to assign agents to properties and create agencies grouping agents. Great for internal purposes or directory listings.
